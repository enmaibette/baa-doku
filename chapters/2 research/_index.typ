#figure(
  table(
    columns: 2,
    table.header([Header 1], [Header 2]),

    [Row 1, Column 1], [Row 1, Column 2],
  ),
  caption: title-caption(
    [This is a table caption title],
    [This is a realllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllly long table caption body. This is not shown in the list of figures.],
  ),
)<T:table2>
